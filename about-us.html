        <h1>About CoderDojo Tucson</h1>
        <p><img src="images/CoderDojoTucsonLong.png" alt="CoderDojo Tucson logo." /></p>
        <p>CoderDojo Tucson is the Tucson, Arizona dojo of the CoderDojo Foundation.</p>
        <p>The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is
            increasingly important in the modern world, that itâ€™s both better and easier to learn
            these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.</p>
        <p>Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a
            website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and 
            social environment. </p>
